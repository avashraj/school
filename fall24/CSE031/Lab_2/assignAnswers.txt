ASSIGNMENT 1
------------

1)line 25 caused the segmentation fault
2)we add the & character before input because we were using an address
3)the bug was that we were passing by value and not by reference.
4)we fix it by passing in a pointer to the function and then using the address sum in the function call


ASSIGNMENT 2
------------

1)the output is expected as it appends the two strings correctly
2)the output is not expected. the bug is that the characters of the
second run just take the first six slots of the previous result.
3) This output is not expected. I think this happens because there is only enough space for the 
amount of characters that were in the first inputs and resluting
combined string.
