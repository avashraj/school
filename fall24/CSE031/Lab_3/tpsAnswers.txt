TPS 1:
1) stack - local variables, heap - dynamically allocated variables,
static memory - global variables
2a) 3 variables
2b) 2 pointers. one is an int pointer the other is a pointer
to an int pointer
2c)stack
2d)heap


TPS 2:
1) NodeStruct.c is a program that creates one node(the head) of a linked list
3)head has a somewhat different address but everything that head points to
is in order. for example fValue is 4 bytes ahead of iValue and next is 
4 bytes ahead of fValue.

1b)the original array is not modified
1c)because we are comparing the sorted array to the unsorted one so wee need both
