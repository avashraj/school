TPS 1:

1)A procedure is a block of code that does something. A function is a procedure with inputs and outputs
A method is a function associated with a class or an object

4) line 20. this line adds the values of $a0 and $a1 and puts it in $v0

5) if we have a label, we can jump back to where it should be

6) line 11 saves the return address. the value of 0 is saved. this value does not make sense

7) when we try to run the program it crashes due to a invalid program counter value

8) the correct address is 0x00400020

9) the correct address is saved

10) 15

11) jal operator


TPS 2:
1) 38
3) when main calls sum, it knows where to go after because of jal
the address returning to main changes to the address returning to sum

4) we can use the stack to store values
5) it gets overwritten by m. we can fix this by saving it to the stack
6)
