TPS 2:

.text directive starts the actual code
.word directive allocates memory

2) Line 10 compares $t3 to $t0 and if they are equal, branches to finish
3) Line 15 jumps back up to fib to restart the fib procces
4) To set a breakpoint, after assembling, you can pick the line to put a 
breakpoint in the execute tab
5) After a breakpoint, you can press the play button to continue running
the code. You can also use the play button with 1 to step through the code.
